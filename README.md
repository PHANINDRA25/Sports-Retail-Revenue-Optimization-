# Sports-Retail-Revenue-Optimization-

Welcome to the Online Sports Clothing Retail Revenue Optimization project repository. As a product analyst for an online sports clothing company, 
I've conducted an extensive SQL analysis to enhance revenue and marketing strategies. 
In this README, I'll provide an overview of the project and the SQL analysis tasks that have been performed.

## Project Overview

In this project, I assumed the role of a product analyst, and I focused on leveraging SQL to explore various aspects of our online sports clothing business.
 The key objectives were to identify opportunities for revenue optimization and provide actionable recommendations. Here are the SQL analysis tasks I've completed:

 1. **Counting Missing Values**:  quantified number of missing values in the dataset to ensure data integrity.

2. **Nike vs. Adidas Pricing**:  analyzed price points of Nike and Adidas products

3. **Price Range Labeling**: Grouped products into price ranges, making it easier to understand pricing distribution.

4. **Average Discount by Brand**: Calculated and compared the average discount percentages for different brands.

5. **Correlation Between Revenue and Reviews**: Investigated the relationship between revenue and customer reviews.

6. **Ratings and Reviews by Product Description Length**: Explored how product description length correlates with ratings and reviews.

7. **Reviews by Month and Brand**: Analyzed reviews over time, focusing on different brands.

8. **Footwear Product Performance**: Evaluated the performance of footwear products in terms of sales and SKUs.

9. **Clothing Product Performance**: Examined the performance of clothing products, wrt footwear products

## Recommendations

Based on the insights gained from the analysis, I've formulated the following recommendations to optimize our marketing strategies and boost revenue:

1. Targeted Sale Strategy - optimizing the stock to have a larger proportion of high-performing products --> boosts revenue
2. Optimizing Discounts: - adjusting discounts as per the brand while closely monitoring sales stability  --> rise in profit
3. Increasing reviews - encourage customer reviews by incentivizing with small discounts on future purchases for reviewing current ones --> engagement & trust
4. Other marketing strategies - referral system & influencer marketing.
